# Trello Clone - Frontend Project

This simple trello clone intends to re-inforce my fundimentals by creating a useful frontend tool. It uses TypeScript and React in order for the code to be as maintainable, modular and clean as possible.
It uses the React DnD (drag and drop) library to the user is able to re-order tasks however they like. All data will be saved in LocalStorage to keep the project's scope reasonable.
