# Trello style Kanban Board Application - Frontend Project

This simple Trello-like app helps me reinforce my fundamentals by building a useful frontend tool. It uses React and TypeScript to ensure maintainable, modular, and clean code. 
With React DnD, users can reorder tasks via drag-and-drop. All data is saved in localStorage to keep the project scope manageable.

 -> Please, do not clone this repository unless you are a recruiter. If you copy my work and try to pass it off as your own (this has happened before!), I will know.
