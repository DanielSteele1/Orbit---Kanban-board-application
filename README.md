# Trello style Kanban Board Application - Frontend Project

This Trello-inspired task management app showcases my ability to build structured, interactive frontends with React and TypeScript. 
I've implemented drag-and-drop functionality using React DnD, enabling smooth task reordering within columns.
To keep the project lightweight and focused on frontend fundamentals, I used localStorage for data persistence, ensuring a responsive and self-contained user experience while maintaining clean, modular, and scalable code.
