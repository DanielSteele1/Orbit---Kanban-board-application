# Trello style Kanban Board Application - Frontend Project

This simple Trello-like app helps me reinforce my fundamentals by building a useful frontend tool. It uses React and TypeScript to ensure maintainable, modular, and clean code. 
With React DnD, users can reorder tasks via drag-and-drop. All data is saved in localStorage to keep the project scope manageable.

 -> Please, do not clone this repository unless you are a recruiter. If you copy my work and try to pass it off as your own (this has happened before!), I will know.

- Add & Delete Columns and Tasks inside each board, in order to track daily goals or current tasks.
- Tick off tasks when their completed.
- All user data saved into LocalStorage. 
- Drag and Drop any column to re-order the board. Especially useful if you have a full board with lots of tasks, and need to reorder everyting quickly. Also planned to be implemented in the main area in which the user see's all thier boards.
